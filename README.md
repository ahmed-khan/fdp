This repository, FDP-Repo, is focused on providing resources and materials for a Faculty Development Program (FDP) titled “Secure Software Delivery in the Age of AI: CI/CD Best Practices with GitHub.” Its main goal is to help faculty and researchers learn about:

Modern DevSecOps practices using GitHub Actions
How to integrate AI tools like GitHub Copilot into development workflows
Building secure software pipelines to address current and future security threats, including quantum computing
Best practices for CI/CD in both academic and production settings
Practical demos on secure pipeline creation and code scanning
Developer well-being concepts (“vibe coding”) to enhance focus
The repo contains workflows, presentations, demos, and code samples to support these topics. If you need details about specific content (e.g., where to find the slides, code demos, or workflows), let me know!
